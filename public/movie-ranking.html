 <h1>Mitch's Favorite Movies</h1>

 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

 <hr/>

 <h3>The Sandlot</h3>
 <p>This movie perfectly illustrates what living in 1950s California summer may be like for a 13 year old. 
    He wants nothing but to be accepted by his neigborhood... and to play ball.
 </p>

 <h3>American Beauty</h3>
 <p>A gross, beautiful, shocking thriller/drama starring the gross man.
    Chilling end to a perfectly shot movie.</p>

<h3>Rounders</h3>
<p>Why must to spend an entire year of pain and fear just to learn a 
    lesson of why you shouldn't trust people or gamble with opportunities.</p>
